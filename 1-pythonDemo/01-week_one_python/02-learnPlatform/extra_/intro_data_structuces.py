#INTRODUCTION TO DATA STRUCTURES
    #Data structures are data types that allow us to store and amange multiple values.
        #where primitive data types are single values(numbers or strings)
        #data structures sllow us to have collections of values in a sinlge variable
            #arrays, lists and dictionaries are examples
    #"singly linked list" -- the lsi t is simply a class that has methods; just like pythons list class has methods like "appned(val)" and "pop()"
