#METHODS--> functions inside of an attribute
#ATTRIBUTES --> variables inside of a class
#INSTANCES == OBJECTS
    #off of the class you're instantiating an object

#OOP(OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING)
    #the basic building blocks of objects(attributes and methods)
    #more advanced concepts include (inheritance, super)
    #the "appened" function  in lists cant be used wtih dictionaries and numbers that's beasue it is a "method"
    #this is becasue each type of thing, or 'object', has specific properties and functionality associated with it.
    #the grouping or "encapsulating", of properties and functionalities by object is a foundational principle of OOP and is 
        #represented with CLASSES
